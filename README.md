# Cumulative-Accessibility-Increment

## CAIResolutionTest.py & CAIResolutionTestMethod2.py

The script is used for

1. Aggregate 1min cumulative accessibility increment data to 2min, 3min, 5min and 10min for resolution tests

2. Identify the maximum CAI index, 10th, 50th and 90th CAI index for each unit of cumulative accessibility increment

The output is used for the travel time estimation models

In the original script, the method used for CAI index identification gives the outputs for both upper and lower boundary of nth percentile index.

In the method 2 script, the method used for CAI index identification only gives the outputs of the exactly nth percentile index.
